# BulkyBook E-Commerce Appliation(Web-App Depolyed On Azure)‚òéÔ∏èüì∂üìû

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build a web application known as BulkyBook application, which is developed using ASP.NET MVC and also deployed on Microsoft Azure Cloud. The application contains register/login validations. It uses an online local sql database of Azure Cloud for authenticating its users and storing the data for each user respectively. The application is basically an e-commerce application using which an end-user can do shopping for his favorite books. The application is also integrated with a payment API known as Stripe using which an end-user can also pay for his order. Also, the application has the mechanism for an admin user who can basically add products, categories and cover types for the books and also manage various orders for the user and change their status to proccessing, shipped, and even cancel the order as well, hence providing a beautiful user interface as well.
